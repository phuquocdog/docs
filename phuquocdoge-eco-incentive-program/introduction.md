# Introduction

The Developer Incentive Program \(DIP\) is a PhuQuoc Doge-native consensus feature that aims to direct a percentage of transaction fees to registered smart contracts to incentivize in PhuQuoc Doge third party contract developers and commons, mainly to boost external dApp development which ultimately enlarges the PhuQuoc Doge DeFi ecosystem overall.

The User Incentive Program\(UIP\) is another PhuQuoc Doge consensus feature aims to Lower the barrier for users to use the PhuQuoc Doge network for transactions. Since PhuQuoc Doge enable the dapp functions of Ethereum chain, there is a fundamental setup to bind PhuQuoc Doge address and virtual Ethereum Address. Then the incentive program will work consistently on both networks.
