# Token Economics

Phu Quoc Dog native coin will be used to:

* Pay transaction and trading fees to get discounts on them
* Participate in on-chain governance of the network
* Become a validator of the network by staking
* Nominate validators and collators of the network
* Users can deploy tokens for their spaces and communitie
* Rent or sell your posts as NFTs
* run ads on pet social networking platforms



### Treasury

The biggest chunk of tokens, 21% (19.7076 BilionPQD), is locked up in the Treasury. These tokens are reserved for giving grants to extend the Phu Quoc Dog ecosystem, building bridges to other blockchains and governance of the Phu Quoc Dog Network.

Treasury is locked by on-chain governance and can be released only by votes of users. Further details of the unlock process and voting system will be in the on-chain proposal

### Parachain auction

10% of the total number of tokens will be reserved for the Parachain auction.

### Staking

Staking will incentivise users to hold PQD in order to receive rewards in PQD tokens. Staking is a mechanism for network validators. It will work in the same way as in the Polkadot network. It is based on the reward curve that will gamify the system. The goal is to keep 50% of the circulating supply of PQD always staked. For more details, please refer to

### Parachain, Integrations & Bridges

It is important for Phu Quoc Dog to become a parachain in the Polkadot network so that it can reduce the cost of bringing tokens from the Ethereum network to Substrate. Becoming a parachain will also allow the trustless movement of these tokens.

In case Phuquocdog does not secure a parachain slot before the Mainnet launch, we will continue to run the project as a solo chain with limited functionality until we secure the slot. That said we applied for the parachain slot and are working on securing it as soon as possible.
