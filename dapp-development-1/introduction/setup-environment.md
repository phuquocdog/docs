# Setup environment

## Install required tools

We're going to develop DApp using truffle and react. So you need to have at least the following tools installed.

### üçä [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org)

Nodejs is the essential tool to develop both smart contract and create the front end app. Install the recent version of node would be enough, by writing this document, we're using v15.4.0.
